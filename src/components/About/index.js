                    We have also learned alot about JavaScript framworks, mainly working with React but also Vue. <br />
                    As part of our education program we had a LIA period/Internship which lasted for 4,5 months.<br/><br/> During this time ive learned alot about working as a developer in a work environment as well as learning new skills such as Angular and a bit of Typescript.
